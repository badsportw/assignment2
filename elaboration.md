# Elaboration for Assignment 5 and 6

## Assignment 5

In this assignment, I wrote a Python program that prints "Hello World" and the name of the class. I used a `main()` function and the `print()` command. The program runs when you execute the file because of the line `if __name__ == '__main__':`. This helped me understand how to organize code using functions.

## Assignment 6

For this part, I made a flowchart using Draw.io in VS Code. The chart shows the steps of my code, like starting, printing messages, and ending. It helped me see how the computer follows each line.

## What I Learned

I learned how to write simple Python code, make a flowchart, and explain my code clearly. I also got practice using VS Code and GitHub.
